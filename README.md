# Contribute to Equity

A web app that allows you to contribute to open source projects of social tech causes as a developer and promote awareness via the representatives involved in the campaigns of the projects. It lets make an impact through tech by empowering social cause and under represented campaigns. 

## How the idea developed ?

The projects assigned to us were [Program Equity](https://github.com/ProgramEquity) and [SayThanks.io](https://saythanks.io/). SayThanks.io lets you send customized messages to developers and Program Equity focuses on creating awareness about different under-represented campaigns. 

We saw a gap in this, something similar to what Program Equity is trying to fill. Just like there are different social good campaigns that go un-noticed due to unawareness, in the same way there are multiple social good tech projects that need recognition and developers to keep it progressing. Correspondingly, there are developers who are trying to make an impact through code are looking for such projects. 

This project serves as a bridge connecting them.

## Why it's even more special

This being an orientation hackathon, we were looking for an idea that could use both the projects that were assigned to us under GitHub. This project is build upon the APIs of both [Program Equity](https://github.com/ProgramEquity) and [SayThanks.io](https://saythanks.io/) which made it more special as we got the chance to explore it even more.
